# tableau_the_coffee_empire
This project was developed in BI Tableau, using the database Kaggle.

It is possible for the user to select his city and check the addresses of available stores.

I used some types of graphics to explain the aspects of Starbucks Stores around the world.
- Map chart: used to show the distribution of stores by country and city.
- Image chart: used to show store owner type with image size varies according to type.
